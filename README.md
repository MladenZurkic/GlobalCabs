## GlobalCabs: Ride Reservation System

### Features:

- The system retrieves estimated distance data from an external API (details about the API not included here).
- Based on the distance and a pre-defined price per kilometer, the system calculates an estimated fare.
- Users can submit their contact information and preferred payment method.
